Paxo
====
Distance field modeling tool

Generates OpenGL shaders which renders the modeled distance fields with raymarching.
Useful for experimental algorithmic art and demoscene productions that have size limitations.

Thanks to IÃ±igo Quilez for his useful articles on distance functions and raymarching.

Setup
-----
Download openframeworks then create a new app with the project generator.

Then in the app directory execute the following:

::

    git init
    git remote add origin git@github.com:rohtie/Paxo.git
